# Notes

The methods we use to pivot tend to vary between the different target operating systems. Frameworks like Metasploit can make the process easier, however, for the time being, we'll be looking at more manual techniques for pivoting.

There are two main methods encompassed in this area of pentesting:

- **Tunnelling/Proxying:** Creating a proxy type connection through a compromised machine in order to route all desired traffic into the targeted network. This could potentially also be  inside another protocol (e.g. SSH tunnelling), which can be useful for evading a basic **I**ntrusion **D**etection **S**ystem (IDS) or firewall

    tunnelled

- **Port Forwarding:** Creating a connection between a local port and a single port on a target, via a compromised host

A proxy is good if we want to redirect lots of different kinds of traffic into our target network -- for example, with an nmap scan, or to access multiple ports on multiple different machines.

Port Forwarding tends to be faster and more reliable, but only allows us to access a single port (or a small range) on a target device.

Which style of pivoting is more suitable will depend entirely on the layout of the network, so we'll have to start with further enumeration before we decide how to proceed. It would be sensible at this point to also start to draw up a layout of the network as you see it -- although in the case of this practice network, the layout is given in the box at the top of the screen.

As a general rule, if you have multiple possible entry-points, try to use a Linux/Unix target where possible, as these tend to be easier to pivot from. An outward facing Linux webserver is absolutely ideal.

The remaining tasks in this section will cover the following topics:

- Enumerating a network using native and statically compiled tools
- Proxychains / FoxyProxy
- SSH port forwarding and tunnelling (primarily Unix)
- plink.exe (Windows)
- socat (Windows and Unix)
- chisel (Windows and Unix)
- sshuttle (currently Unix only)

This is far from an exhaustive list of the tools available for pivoting, so further research is encouraged.
